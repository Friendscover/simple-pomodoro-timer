# Overview
This is a webpage I built in 2020 with help of the TheOdinProject. The goal was to create a Pomodoro Timer with a little bit of Javascript and Design it with CSS. The most critical part of the project was using the `setInterval` Function ([MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval)). This function helped me build a basic pomodoro timer

# Looking back in 2022 
After taking a glance at the source code for this project, I am intending to clean up the code and fix some bugs. My current goal is to rewrite the source and include more features. The most useful feature would be to include a sound indicator if the current time has reached 0.
